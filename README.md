# DigitalGreen/CropManage Chatbot

This is the repository containing all of the files for the DigitalGreen/CropManage Chatbot, a project started by three fellows who were a part of the 2024 AIFS Career Exploration Fellowship Program. Through building upon the current DigitalGreen FarmerChat AI technology, the project would allow for CropManage users to easily access and input information into CropManage from their own phone, essentially serving as a simple and accessible way to use CropManage. 

# References/Technologies
Here are the technologies used for development of the chatbot:
- CropManage Web Application (https://cropmanage.ucanr.edu/)
- CropManage API Documentation (https://api.cropmanage.ucanr.edu/help)
- DigitalGreen MonoRepo (https://github.com/digitalgreenorg/DG_Open)

# File Descriptions
**get_requests.py**
- File containing methods for all of the GET requests available on the CropManage API. Six (6) of the requests are currently not working for third-party use (Python Requests, Postman, etc.).

**post_requests.py**
- File containing methods for all of the POST requests available on the CropManage API. Twelve (12) of the requests are currently not working for third-party use (Python Requests, Postman, etc.).

**put_requests.py**
- File containing methods for all of the PUT requests available on the CropManage API. All eight (8) of the requests are currently not working for third-party use (Python Requests, Postman, etc.).

**delete_requests.py**
- File containing methods for all of the DELETE requests available on the CropManage API. All twelve (12) of the requests are currently not working for third-party use (Python Requests, Postman, etc.).

**.env**
- File containing the environment variables used by most of the Python files in this repository.

**get-crop-manage-token.py**
- File containing a program to obtain a CropManage user's access token for API testing. Updates the *ACCESS_TOKEN* environment variable in *.env* after a successful execution.

**json_to_pdf.py**
- File containing the functions that convert a JSON to a PDF file. Used to augment the JSON responses from the CropManage API requests to make it easier for DigitalGreen's FarmerChat's knowledge base, FarmStack, to embed/chunk and understand.

**crop_manage.ipynb**
- Jupyter Notebook file which contains all of the functions that convert the results of the methods in *get_requests.py* to JSON/CSV files. Generated files were intended to feed FarmerChat's knowledge base and train the chatbot model. Currently still a work in progress.

**csv/**
